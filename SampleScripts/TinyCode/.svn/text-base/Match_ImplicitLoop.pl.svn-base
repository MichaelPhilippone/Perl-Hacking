# Tiny code in Perl
#	The code above uses the -n option which implies
#	that it runs within a loop that reads each line
#	in turn from a file named on the command line
#	and stores it in the "default input and pattern
#	matching space" a.k.a. $_ ...
#
#	It's open to debate whether or not coding in this
#	way is good practise - my personal view is that
#	it's great for occasional utilities where you just
#	need to quickly filter a data file on one or two
#	occasions, but it's not a good idea for long term
#	coding where you need to have maintaiance in mind.
